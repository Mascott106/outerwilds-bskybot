"257": [
"I'm no expert, but you seem pretty real to me."
],
"258": [
"I guess so!"
],
"259": [
"Oh geez, Feldspar would just use the time loop to try increasingly outlandish stunts, wouldn't they. Might be a good thing they aren't aware of it."
],
"260": [

"Are you being sassy? You can't sass me! You are me!"
],

"Does kind of prove we're the same person, though."

"Yeah! That feels like ages ago. \nWe'd have died that first time out if the time loop didn't exist, though. Isn't that weird to think about?"

"296": [
"It's unsettling to think about. Especially when you remember even Riebeck survived their first launch."
],
"297": [
"YES. I can’t believe no one was around to see that. \nWe’re probably the best pilot in the space program by now."
],
"298": [
"Yeah, but we’ve also died more than anyone else."
],
"299": [
"Not that anyone else knows it."

],
"3673": [
"That’s true.  I’m not sure how to factor that in."

"303": [
"Still, it’s kind of nice to get to say it out loud. Even if it’s just to ourself."
],
"304": [
"That’s fine. It’s kind of nice to hear it said out loud."
],
"305": [
"What? ...Oh, come on, don’t take that away from us!"
],
"306": [
"Just kidding, I don't care how time works."
],
"307": [
"But given it only happened in a previous loop..."
],

"CLARY: Regarding the warp towers on Ash Twin: Does each tower have to be perfectly aligned with the center of the astral body to which it’s tuned?"
],
"311": [
"CLARY: I enjoy precision as much as the next Nomai, but if, for example, a tower’s base were to shift even slightly, that tower might no longer align with its astral body."
],
"312": [
"POKE: We don’t need the alignment angle to be exact; it only needs to be within five degrees of the astral body’s center."
],
"313": [
"POKE: Of note: This gives us a slightly longer warp window. I imagine this window will last roughly several seconds."
],
"314": [
"POKE: As such, any Nomai stepping onto the warp platform during the active window will be immediately warped. We will need to be careful around the platform for the duration of the time it’s active to avoid accidental transportation."
],
"315": [
"CLARY: More accurately, I enjoy precision as much as the next Nomai, provided the next Nomai is not Poke."

"ROOT: Where am I taking this first black hole core? (And where am I taking the remaining cores once they’re ready?)"

"317": [
"CLARY: All of the warp towers are being constructed on Ash Twin, so the black hole cores will go there."
],
"318": [
"POKE: The white hole cores are for the warp receivers. Each of the six receivers are being constructed at different locations, so those deliveries will be a greater pain in your cervical spine."
],
"319": [
"ROOT: My gratitude! In that case: Poke, Clary, I’m leaving for delivery! I’ll send Yarrow your regards."
],
"320": [
"CLARY: Poke, I’ll return to the forge shortly; I’m going to catch up to Root and help him deliver the first core to Ash Twin, just to make sure Yarrow receives it."
],
"321": [
"POKE: Of course you are."
],
"322": [
"POKE: The tower designs in the High Energy Lab on Ember Twin reveal each receiver's location. Ask Yarrow; he is familiar with them."
],
"323": [
"WARNING: Be cautious near the boarding area while the Black Hole Forge is in operation."
],
"324": [
"POKE: Of note: Yarrow believes he spotted a flaw in the warp tower designs: namely, that one of the warp towers on Ash Twin will never activate, because its warp receiver will never align overhead."
],
"325": [
"POKE: Does your romantic interest think a warp tower’s alignment point is its receiver? Does he not know that a warp tower always aligns with the center of its corresponding astral body?"
],
"326": [
"CLARY: That isn’t an unreasonable belief, given the receiver does have to be located on (or in close orbit around) the relevant astral body."
],
"327": [
"CLARY: I seem to recall that was your understanding of warp technology, at first."
],
"328": [
"CLARY: No, Yarrow understands the distinction. He likely doesn’t realize the Hourglass Twins are so close together they function as a single astral body, with a shared alignment point in between them."

"ROOT: What if we used warp towers (like the one we have on the White Hole Station) to connect Ash Twin directly to each critical location?"
],
"333": [
"CLARY: Poke, Root, and I can begin work on this immediately in the Black Hole Forge (this will keep us busy!)."

"335": [
"PHLOX: We can design each tower to visually reflect its warp destination!"

"OENO: This is exciting news! Can I offer an extra set of eyes for this final check (specifically, mine)? If my work here is complete, I’d be delighted to help."
],
"351": [
"YARROW: We’d be grateful if you would! The more eyes, the better, as the smallest flaw or opening in the shell that protects the Ash Twin Project could lead to disaster."
],
"352": [
"OENO: I’m still amazed by how much ore the Ash Twin Project requires!"
],
"353": [
"CYCAD: Isn’t this the ore for the remaining towers being built on Ash Twin? The completed towers I’ve seen are quite large!"
],
"354": [

"363": [
"POKE: Every warp tower is tuned to a specific astral body. A tower's warp can only be used during the brief window when the tower is aligned with its corresponding astral body (in this case, Brittle Hollow)."

"You must be standing on the warp platform on the floor during this alignment to be warped."

"Nice, it’s you. Good to see you made it here in one piece. The first solo launch is a doozy, isn’t it?"
],

"So hey, don’t freak out or anything, but lately I keep, like, dying repeatedly. I dunno, it’s pretty weird."
],
"369": [
"What about you? Have you died lately, or is it just me?"
],
"370": [
"No, it’s me, too. We’re in a time loop."

"Time has been behaving unusually lately. Yeah, a time loop makes sense. Cool."

"You’re taking this pretty well."
],
"373": [
"What did you think it was?"
],
"374": [
"Heh, right back at you."
],
"375": [
"Personally, I like new experiences, and I’ve never been in a time loop before. I mean, I don’t think I’ve been in a time loop before this one."
],
"376": [
"I figured it’d be some kind of fidgety time business, but I wasn’t really thinking about what’s happening to the shape of time, you know? But a loop makes sense here. Let’s go with “loop” for now."
],
"377": [
"It looks like you and I are the only ones who can tell that time’s gone all weird. I tried radioing Hornfels and asking if they’d died, too, but they thought I was being metaphorical."
],
"378": [
"Even if I tell Hornfels about the time loop, they never remember by the next one. They don’t realize anything’s different."
],
"379": [
"And here’s another weird one for you - every time I die, all of my memories from that loop replay back to me. I’m pretty sure that’s related to this big stone Nomai statue I found on one of the other islands."
],
"380": [
"I was looking at it, and the statue opened its eyes and started glowing. It replayed my memories like it’d seen them through my own eyes, just like what happens each time I die."
],
"381": [
"That happened to me with the statue at the museum."
],
"382": [
"You too, huh? Then the Nomai statues must have something to do with why we’re the only ones aware of the time loop. So... no glowing statue, no time loop awareness?"
],
"383": [
"I think that’s going to be my leading theory, but if you find out anything new about the statues or the time loop, let me know, okay? I’ll be here."
],
"384": [
"Anyway, that’s what’s new with me. But hey, this is your first solo voyage! ...Kind of! Let’s talk about you, you know?"
],
"385": [
"Have you ever watched a cyclone for so long, it started to hypnotize you? I’m telling you, they’ll put you in a trance if you stare at ’em long enough."
],
"386": [
"How’s space treating you?"
],
"387": [
"I found something!"
],
"388": [
"What are you doing out here?"
],
"389": [
"Where should I explore on Giant’s Deep?"
],
"390": [
"What’s up with this planet?"
],
"391": [
"Where’s your ship?"
],
"392": [
"I found your ship!"
],
"393": [
"I saw your ship again."
],
"394": [
"See you later."
],
"395": [
"Well, what are any of us doing here, really?"
],
"396": [
"...Nah, I’m just kidding. I’m out here exploring our solar system, same as you."
],
"397": [
"But I tell you what, outer space really gives you room to think. It’s quiet and peaceful out here."
],
"398": [
"I mean, it’s usually quiet and peaceful. Sometimes a cyclone comes by and lifts my little island paradise clean out of the water. Then: less peaceful."
],
"399": [
"Here’s something you might like — at the start of every time loop, I keep seeing a bright flash in the sky. Something must be happening up there in orbit around the planet."
],
"400": [
"What else, what else... Have you been to Statue Island? That’s what I’ve been calling it, seeing as it’s the island where I found the glowing Nomai statue. ...Get it?"
],
"401": [
"I was on the beach on Statue Island when the whole glowy business happened, by the way. It’s a nice beach for that kind of thing. I give it a solid 7 out of 10 on the Gabbro Relaxation Scale."
],
"402": [
"If you feel like checking out Statue Island, it’s the one with two islands connected by a natural rock arch. Well... mostly connected, anyway. You’ll see."
],
"403": [
"Haha, I know, right?"
],
"404": [
"...Oh, you meant, like, tell you more about it? I gotcha. Well, Giant’s Deep is massive, and mostly water. No surprises there."
],
"405": [
"There’s a strong current a ways beneath the surface that prevents anything from sinking below it. Seriously, I tried everything I could think of to get past that current, and neither idea worked."
],
"406": [
"As for land masses, I’ve counted four islands, including this one. There’s also the one with that Nomai statue I saw on the beach."
],
"407": [
"You’ve seen the cyclones? Yeah, they’re hard to miss. They’ll toss up everything in their path, islands included. Little tip — if you get picked up, try to land in water. Less likely to kill you."
],
"408": [
"That’s a good question."
],
"409": [
"It’s definitely on this planet somewhere. I mean, unless a cyclone came by and tossed it into space, I guess. Heh, that would be pretty nuts."
],
"410": [
"I hope it’s not lonely."
],
"411": [
"An excellent question. I haven’t seen it around lately."
],
"412": [
"I hope it’s not lonely."
],
"413": [
"Oh, cool. So it’s floating in the ocean, huh?"
],
"414": [
"Did it look like it was having a good time?"
],
"415": [
"I hope it’s having fun! Did you say hi for me?"
],
"416": [
"Cool, cool. Take it easy out there."
],
"417": [
"Nice, nice. Whatcha got for me?"
],
"418": [
"I reached the inside of Statue Island."
],
"419": [
"I found the source of the time loop."
],
"420": [
"I found Nomai masks inside the Ash Twin Project."
],
"421": [
"I found what happened to the Orbital Probe Cannon."
],
"422": [
"I found your quantum poem."
],
"423": [
"I found a photo of you inside the old radio tower."
],
"424": [
"Actually, nevermind."
],
"425": [
"So the Nomai created those head statues to record memories, huh? ...Yeah, I could see the Nomai doing that. Not sure what for, but it seems like their sort of thing."
],
"426": [
"Do you think the statues are recording our memories, then? ’Cause I remember that one on the beach looked at me funny. That must be my memory-friend!"
],
"427": [
"Right, right, the cavern inside Statue Island is where the memory-recording statues were made, I remember."
],
"428": [
"So your memory statue is the one in the museum back in the crater, and mine’s the one I found on the beach. I kinda dig having my own personal memory-friend."
],
"429": [
"If you come up with any hunches about what the Nomai wanted to record memories for, feel free to run them by me! You know where I’ll be."
],
"430": [
"Wait, whoa, really? The Nomai carved out the Ash Twin and built a time loop device inside? ...That is wild."
],
"431": [
"Now we know what’s causing the loop, then. And... if it’s caused by a device, that must mean it had to be switched on, right? Huh..."
],
"432": [
"Hey, what do you think would happen if you turned off the time loop? Like, there’s a part of me thinks maybe you shouldn’t, what with the sun blowing up and all."
],
"433": [
"Then again, who wants to spend eternity being blown up by the sun?"
],
"434": [
"...I dunno, I’m no time loop expert. I’m just gonna sit here and ponder the intricacies of time and space. Maybe take a nap, too, if I feel like it."
],
"435": [
"My head’s still all full of scenarios for what would happen if you turned off the time loop. I’ll probably notice if you decide to mess with it, though, right? Seems like something I’d notice."
],
"436": [
"This is all pretty wild."
],
"437": [
"You’re saying the statues were made so memories could be sent back in time? I guess that makes sense, considering we both have our memories of every loop we’ve gone through."
],
"438": [
"Wait, then it’s just our memories being sent back in time to us, right? Then... are we really experiencing multiple time loops, or not?"
],
"439": [
"That’s pretty deep... Like, maybe our consciousnesses have been through all these loops, but maybe our bodies haven’t, because technically the loops never happened."
],
"440": [
"Meaning we’re receiving memories of things that will never happen to us. Cool, huh?"
],
"441": [
"Right, you told me earlier that the point of the statues is to send memories back in time. Which I guess makes sense, considering we both have our memories of every loop we’ve gone through."
],
"442": [
"I thought about it some more, and I think that means our minds have gone through all these loops, but we haven’t actually gone through them ourselves."
],
"443": [
"Meaning we’re receiving memories of things that technically will never happen to us. Cool, huh?"
],
"444": [
"Whoa, that’s the cannon breaking apart at the start of each time loop? For real?"
],
"445": [
"Did you figure out why?"
],
"446": [
"Too much power."
],
"447": [
"Overenthusiasm."
],
"448": [
"...It’s kind of scary how much that sounds like something Slate or Feldspar would do. I’m pretty surprised the Nomai built something that actually broke!"
],
"449": [
"Come to think of it, though, “broke” might be the wrong word. Because it looks like the Orbital Probe Cannon is still firing successfully at the beginning of each time loop."
],
"450": [
"So the cannon breaks apart right after it launches, huh. Explains what I’m seeing fall from the sky every loop."
],
"451": [
"I’m still surprised the Nomai built something that isn’t holding together, you know? Them being genius crafters and all."
],
"452": [
"On the other hand, maybe we should be impressed they made something that could last until modern day in the first place. And it looks like the cannon is still firing successfully at the start of each time loop."
],
"453": [
"Yeah, the one in the woods, I remember writing that. Pretty fun, right? It works out to a good 24 poems."
],
"454": [
"When I’m done exploring, I want to make some more quantum art. Maybe some kind of creature sculpture that just, like, shows up and scares the daylights out of you."
],
"455": [
"Yeah, you mentioned that before. Did I look busy in it? I hope I looked busy."
],
"456": [
"Nice. Did I look busy in it? I hope I looked busy."
],
"457": [
"Must have been from the time Hornfels sent me to check on the deep space satellite. They thought Ol’ Spacey might be malfunctioning, but I couldn’t find a single thing wrong with it."
],
"458": [
"Which is probably how it got a shot of my beautiful be-helmeted face, come to think of it."
],
"459": [
"I always thought it was kinda sweet that the best way to find Ol’ Spacey is to use a map that’s generated by the satellite itself, isn’t it? Like it’s inviting us to visit. Good ol’ deep space satellite, always making sure we know where we’re going."
],
"460": [
"Why’d Hornfels think it was broken?"
],
"461": [
"Um. “Ol’ Spacey”?"
],
"462": [
"I have a map?!"
],
"463": [
"Dunno. Hornfels probably told me why, but Hornfels tells me lots of things, and sometimes I tune out. Or pretend there’s signal interference and I can’t hear them."
],
"464": [
"Best guess says the deep space satellite must have sent Timber Hearth some weird pictures, but like… what’s considered “weird” for a satellite, you know?"
],
"465": [
"Anyway, if you ever want to visit Ol’ Spacey, fastest way is to jump into your ship and use your solar system map to lock on to the satellite, same as you would any astral body."
],
"466": [
"I mean, the satellite’s not super old, but it’s hardly brand-new. “Ol’” is more a term of affection. ...You’re being very literal-minded about this."
],
"467": [
"Ol’ Spacey likes visitors, you know! Fastest way to find it is to jump into your ship and use your solar system map to lock on to our faithful satellite friend, same as you would any astral body."
],
"468": [
"Yeah, um, the one that’s standard with all our spacesuits? The one you have with you at all times that opens with the press of a button? …That map?"
],
"469": [
"You didn’t get conked on the head by a rock or a meteorite or something on your way here, did you? No shame in that. Happens to me all the time!"
],
"470": [
"In case you were hit especially hard, don’t forget that you can jump into your ship and use your solar system map to lock on to any astral body. It’s the easiest way to visit Ol’ Spacey, too."
],
"471": [
"No worries. Feel free to let me know when you do find something cool, though. You know where to find me."
],
"472": [
"I was hoping you’d be back - something really weird is going on."
],
"473": [
"Do you think we’re in a time loop?"
],
"474": [
"We’re definitely in a time loop."
],
"475": [
"Yeah, a time loop makes the most sense, right? Or at least, it’s some kind of fidgety time business. Hard to say what’s happening to the shape of time, exactly, but let’s go with “loop” for now."
],
"476": [
"Oh. Yeah, that makes sense. Cool."
],
"477": [
"You’re taking this pretty well."
],
"478": [
"What did you think it was?"
],
"479": [
"Heh, right back at you. Personally, I like new experiences, and I’ve never been in a time loop before."
],
"480": [
"Well. I don’t think I’ve been in a time loop before this one, but then, it’s not like I can know that for sure."
],
"481": [
"I figured it’d be some kind of fidgety time business, but I wasn’t really thinking about what’s happening to the shape of time, you know? But a loop makes sense here. Let’s go with “loop” for now."
],
"482": [
"So it looks like you and I are the only ones who know we’re in a time loop. And even if you tell them about it, no one remembers by the next loop. What’s with that?"
],
"483": [
"Maybe it’s because we both made some seriously intense eye contact with a Nomai statue?"
],
"484": [
"I’m seeing my memories replay each time I die, just like I did when the Nomai statue on the beach opened its eyes and looked at me. So maybe... no glowing statue, no time loop awareness?"
],
"485": [
"I think that’s going to be my leading theory, but if you find out anything new about the statues or the time loop, let me know, okay? I’ll be here."
],
"486": [
"Hey, my time buddy’s back!"
],
"487": [
"So what’s new?"
],
"488": [
"Well, what are any of us doing here, really?"
],
"489": [
"...Nah, I’m just kidding. I’m out here exploring our solar system, same as you."
],
"490": [
"But I tell you what, outer space really gives you room to think. It’s quiet and peaceful out here."
],
"491": [
"I mean, it’s usually quiet and peaceful. Sometimes a cyclone comes by and lifts my little island paradise clean out of the water. Then: less peaceful."
],
"492": [
"Here’s something you might like — at the start of every time loop, I keep seeing a bright flash in the sky. Something must be happening up there in orbit around the planet."
],
"493": [
"What else, what else... Have you been to Statue Island? That’s what I’ve been calling it, seeing as it’s the island where I found the glowing Nomai statue. ...Get it?"
],
"494": [
"I was on the beach on Statue Island when the whole glowy business happened, by the way. It’s a nice beach for that kind of thing. I give it a solid 7 out of 10 on the Gabbro Relaxation Scale."
],
"495": [
"If you feel like checking out Statue Island, it’s the one with two islands connected by a natural rock arch. Well... mostly connected, anyway. You’ll see."
],
"496": [
"Haha, I know, right?"
],
"497": [
"...Oh, you meant, like, tell you more about it? I gotcha. Well, Giant’s Deep is massive, and mostly water. No surprises there."
],
"498": [
"There’s a strong current a ways beneath the surface that prevents anything from sinking below it. Seriously, I tried everything I could think of to get past that current, and neither idea worked."
],
"499": [
"As for land masses, I’ve counted four islands, including this one. There’s also the one with that Nomai statue I saw on the beach."
],
"500": [
"You’ve seen the cyclones? Yeah, they’re hard to miss. They’ll toss up everything in their path, islands included. Little tip - if you get picked up, try to land in water. Less likely to kill you."
],
"501": [
"So the Nomai created those head statues to record memories, huh? ...Yeah, I could see the Nomai doing that. Not sure what for, but it seems like their sort of thing."
],
"502": [
"Do you think the statues are recording our memories, then? ’Cause I remember that one on the beach looked at me funny. That must be my memory-friend!"
],
"503": [
"Wait, whoa, really? The Nomai carved out Ash Twin and built a time loop device inside? ...That is wild."
],
"504": [
"Now we know what’s causing the loop, then. And... if it’s caused by a device, that must mean it had to be switched on, right? Huh..."
],
"505": [
"Hey, what do you think would happen if you turned off the time loop? Like, there’s a part of me thinks maybe you shouldn’t, what with the sun blowing up and all."
],
"506": [
"Then again, who wants to spend eternity being blown up by the sun?"
],
"507": [
"...I dunno, I’m no time loop expert. I’m just gonna sit here and ponder the intricacies of time and space. Maybe take a nap, too, if I feel like it."
],
"508": [
"You’re saying the statues were made so memories could be sent back in time? I guess that makes sense, considering we both have our memories of every loop we’ve gone through."
],
"509": [
"Wait, then it’s just our memories being sent back in time to us, right? Then... are we really experiencing multiple time loops, or not?"
],
"510": [
"That’s pretty deep... Like, maybe our consciousnesses have been through all these loops, but maybe our bodies haven’t, because technically the loops never happened."
],
"511": [
"Meaning we’re receiving memories of things that will never happen to us. Cool, huh?"
],
"512": [
"Whoa, that’s the cannon breaking apart at the start of each time loop? For real?"
],
"513": [
"Did you figure out why?"
],
"514": [
"Too much power."
],
"515": [
"Overenthusiasm."
],
"516": [
"...It’s kind of scary how much that sounds like something Slate or Feldspar would do. I’m pretty surprised the Nomai built something that actually broke!"
],
"517": [
"Come to think of it, though, “broke” might be the wrong word. Because it looks like the Orbital Probe Cannon is still firing successfully at the beginning of each time loop."
],
"518": [
"So the cannon breaks apart right after it launches, huh. Explains what I’m seeing fall from the sky every loop."
],
"519": [
"I’m still surprised the Nomai built something that isn’t holding together, you know? Them being genius crafters and all."
],
"520": [
"On the other hand, maybe we should be impressed they made something that could last until modern day in the first place. And it looks like the cannon is still firing successfully at the start of each time loop."
],
"521": [
"Yeah, the one in the woods, I remember writing that. Pretty fun, right? It works out to a good 24 poems."
],
"522": [
"When I’m done exploring, I want to make some more quantum art. Maybe some kind of creature sculpture that just, like, shows up and scares the daylights out of you."
],
"523": [
"Hey, time pal! Nice weather we’re having, huh? ...Wait. Have I used that one before?"
],
"524": [
"If it isn’t my time buddy! How’s space treating you this loop?"
],
"525": [
"Heyo, time buddy. It’s a good thing I never get bored of rain, huh?"
],
"526": [
"You know, I kind of wish I’d built a hammock here before we ended up in this time loop."
],
"527": [
"A few loops ago, a cyclone came by and tossed my little island into space. Dying like that was kind of unpleasant."
],
"528": [
"Hello again. ...Again."
],
"529": [
"What’s up?"
],
"530": [
"How do you stay so calm in the face of repeated impending death?"
],
"531": [
"Deep breaths... no, seriously, I meditate."
],
"532": [
"Want me to teach you? It'll be the next loop before you know it."
],
"533": [
"Sure, why not."
],
"534": [
"Nah, I'm good."
],
"535": [
"Ok, close your eyes..."
],
"536": [
"Ok, let me know if you change your mind. Time flies when you're in a deep, meditative trance."
],
"537": [
"Well, what are any of us doing here, really?"
],
"538": [
"...Nah, I’m just kidding. I’m out here exploring our solar system, same as you."
],
"539": [
"But I tell you what, outer space really gives you room to think. It’s quiet and peaceful out here."

"RECORDING"

"570": [
"Gabbro here, checking in on the deep space satellite per ground control's request to check out a possible equipment problem. See, Hornfels? I do too work!"
],
"571": [
"You know, I wouldn’t mind being a satellite. It's peaceful out here, among the distant stars and the soft, velvety darkness… Bet it's (yawn) awfully nice for naps, too..."
],
"572": [
"..."
],
"573": [
"Oh, right. The lens."
],
"574": [
"Alright, little satellite, let's see what the trouble is."
],
"575": [
"...Huh. Everything looks a-okay, ground control. No dust or scratches on the lens, and no evidence of sparking or violent explosions. Guess that rules out an equipment malfunction, after all."
],
"576": [
"Hear that, pal? You’re in great shape. Keep up the good work out here!"
],
"577": [
"SIGN"
],
"578": [
"CLOSED DUE TO FIRE DAMAGE"
],
"579": [
"The old radio tower, while an important landmark, is unfortunately closed thanks to the unsanctioned flight testing of an extremely powerful model rocket."
],
"580": [
"While we hope to repair the radio tower in the future, all construction efforts are currently focused on the planned museum expansion at the Observatory."
],
"581": [
"Sincerest apologies, except to Slate and Mica, \nHornfels (museum curator)"
],
"582": [
"The radio tower here on Timber Hearth was built to receive transmissions from our deep space satellite, and to this day still houses the first-ever photos taken of the entire solar system."
],
"583": [
"These photos were made possible by the deep space satellite’s unusual vertical orbit that carries it high above (and below) the plane of the solar system."
],
"584": [
"Thanks to a recent upgrade, the deep space satellite is now responsible for generating the real-time solar system map used by our newest astronauts."
],
"585": [
"Our new expansion was made possible by the generous contributions of esteemed museum visitors like you. Thank you very much for your support!"
],
"586": [
"FUTURE SITE OF OUR NEXT EXHIBIT!"
],
"587": [
"If you’ve enjoyed your time with Outer Wilds, please consider supporting our planned museum expansion."
],
"588": [
"Our quest to explore the furthest reaches of our solar system wouldn’t be possible without generous visitors like you! We thank you profusely for your support, and we hope to see you again soon."
],
"589": [
],
"590": [
"There’s our pilot! Back from your pre-launch campout under the stars, I see."
],
"591": [
"So it’s Launch Day, eh? Seems like only yesterday you joined the space program, and suddenly here you are, leaving on your first solo voyage."
],
"592": [
"What do you say - ready to get this beauty off the ground? It’s all fueled up and ready to go!"
],
"593": [
"All systems go!"
],
"594": [
"I’m ready if you are."
],
"595": [
"You’re sure you fixed the retro rockets?"
],
"596": [
"Hey, you ready to get this thing off the ground? Ship’s all fueled and ready to go."
],
"597": [
"Did... did I just... die?"
],
"598": [
"All systems go!"
],
"599": [
"I’m ready if you are."
],
"600": [
"You’re sure you fixed the retro rockets?"
],
"601": [
"Whoa, bad dream or something? You still look half asleep, but that’s a negative on being deceased."
],
"602": [
"I know it’s tradition to sleep out under the stars the night before a launch, but if you ask me it makes you all a bit jumpy."
],
"603": [
"Glad you’re excited, but remember, if you wreck the ship I’m not building you a new one. I’m not made of lightweight reentry grade aluminum alloys, you know."
],
"604": [
"Are you kidding? Of course I’m ready - it’s finally time to test the new landing hydraulics with a pilot instead of the autoflight system!"
],
"605": [
"...Speaking of pilots, make sure you don’t crash the ship the first time you put it down, you hear?"
],
"606": [
"That was only a problem one time. And then maybe a few times after that, but hey, no reason to dwell on the past, right?"
],
"607": [
"Anyway, you’ll need to get the launch codes from Hornfels at the observatory before you can lift off. Just bring those here once you’ve said your goodbyes or whatever."
],
"608": [
"Not having second thoughts, are you?"
],
"609": [
"Where are the launch codes again?"
],
"610": [
"How’s the ship looking?"
],
"611": [
"How safe would you say this thing is?"
],
"612": [
"What’s my mission once I’m in space?"
],
"613": [
"What else should I do before liftoff?"
],
"614": [
"Hey, you’re the pilot - you tell me. Aren’t you pilot-types all eager to get up there and explore for yourselves?"
],
"615": [
"Doesn’t matter if you go to the moon or Brittle Hollow or just the other side of Timber Hearth. It’s all the same to me. Get out there and have fun!"
],
"616": [
"Just don’t hurt the ship, that’s all I ask."
],
"617": [
"If you have any goodbyes to say, better say ’em now. I think your friend Hal is in the observatory waiting to see you off."
],
"618": [
"Oh, and Gossan says they have the zero-g chamber set up if you want a refresher on making ship repairs in space. Not saying you have to, but uh, it’d help get Gossan off my back if you did."
],
"619": [
"Hornfels has the launch codes. Should be up at the observatory, like usual. I’m starting to think they live there."
],
"620": [
"Great! Hey, you might get a kick out of this - I’ve repurposed the spare oxygen tank to be used as an extra combustion chamber!"
],
"621": [
"What does that do?"
],
"622": [
"Is that... safe?"
],
"623": [
"Well, it’s all very conceptual, but basically, it’s like taking a regular second-stage booster and strapping a bigger rocket onto it.\nIsn’t that great?"
],
"624": [
"Probably!"
],
"625": [
"Oh, it’s a perfect ten. Unless you’re factoring in pilot error, in which case it’s about a four. \nNo offense."
],
"626": [
"Oh, hold up, you’re going to want to get the launch codes from the observatory first."
],
"627": [
"I already got them from the observatory, remember?"
],
"628": [
"How did I get back here? Didn’t I already lift off?"
],
"629": [
"Wait, did I just die, or...?"
],
"630": [
"Huh. Must be inhaling more fumes than I realized. That stuff is potent."
],
"631": [
"Well, if you’ve got the codes, I’m not gonna stop you. Good luck, and take care of that ship!"
],
"632": [
"Trust me -- with the modifications I’ve made to those rockets? There’s no way I would have missed that."
],
"633": [
"I won’t ask how you got the launch codes, but since you have ’em, get a move on! I want to see whether the new cockpit stays attached during liftoff."
],
"634": [
"Uh, no...? You have a bad dream or something?"
],
"635": [
"I won’t ask how you got the codes, so hurry up and launch before Hornfels decides to ground you for medical reasons.  I want to see whether the new cockpit stays attached during liftoff."
],
"636": [
"Looks like you’re ready for takeoff! The excitement of a launch is fun and all, but I can’t wait to get back to working on the new ship. \nWe’re working on fixing the autopilot’s avoidance system for this one!"
],
"637": [
"...Uh, sorry."
],
"638": [
"There’s our pilot! Ready to get this beauty off the ground?"
],
"639": [
"Hey, what can I do you for?"
],
"640": [
"You know the ship is a death-trap, right?"
],
"641": [
"You’re lucky I’m in a time loop, because otherwise I’d be super dead."
],
"642": [
"The autopilot flew my ship directly into the sun!"
],
"643": [
"I keep getting killed by ghost matter."
],
"644": [
"The sun is going to go supernova, by the way."
],
"645": [
"Did you know it’s just an endless void outside our solar system?"
],
"646": [
"Well yeah, it’s a death-trap, but a really powerful death trap. What, you suddenly care about safety now?"
],
"647": [
"And you’re lucky I don’t have you grounded for medical reasons, because I have no idea what you’re talking about."
],
"648": [
"Had an exciting dream, did you?"
],
"649": [
"It’s not exactly impossible for the autopilot to get you too close to the sun, but it’s not like it’ll try to take you there on purpose."
],
"650": [
"Make sure the sun isn’t between you and your destination when you engage autopilot, and you’ll be fine."
],
"651": [
"Not if you use your scout to detect it, you won’t, you dumb idiot! Did you think I made that just so you could take pretty little pictures of trees? It has multiple uses!"
],
"652": [
"You do know you can use it as a light source, right? Stars above, please tell me you knew that."
],
"653": [
"Oh yeah, the observatory has an exhibit about that."
],
"654": [
"Between you and me, I glossed over some of the finer details. Astrophysics is really more Hornfels’s domain."
],
"655": [
"Me, I’m here for the rocket science and the marshmallows."
],
"656": [
"Yeah, I’d stick to exploring our solar system, if I were you. As much as I hate to admit it, our ships aren’t deep-space-worthy."
],
"657": [
"Hey, hold up a sec!"
],
"658": [
"Yeah yeah yeah, I already know about the launch codes."
],
"659": [
"What? No, I was going to tell you about using the ship log to set destination markers for locations you’ve visited before."
],
"660": [
"It’s a brilliant feature, if I say so myself. Dead useful. And the risk it poses of shorting out the fuel regulator and causing the ship to explode is so minimal that only Gossan would worry about it."
],
"661": [
"Wait, so how do I use it?"
],
"662": [
"Use the ship log to mark a location I want to revisit. Got it."
],
"663": [
"How minimal are we talking?"
],
"664": [
"What about locations I haven’t visited before?"
],
"665": [
"When you’re on your ship, open up its log to the location you want to mark. Anywhere’s fine, as long as you’ve been there at least once."
],
"666": [
"Hop in the pilot seat, and the ship will throw up a destination marker on your display. It’s that easy."
],
"667": [
"Minimal! Stars above, you worry too much. If anything’s going to kill you, it’s the autopilot."
],
"668": [
"Oh, sure, I’ll just magically have the system know all the possible locations you plan to discover throughout the entire solar system, shall I?"
],
"669": [
"“Wow, Slate! How do you come up with these incredible ideas?” Oh, I do the best I can with what I’ve got. Really, you’re too kind."
],
"670": [

"This was extraordinarily convenient timing. Thanks!"

],
"674": [
"Sure thing, hatchling!"
],
"675": [
"Everyone’s a critic."
],
"676": [
"Anyway, I’ve got a fire to enjoy, and you’ve got launch codes to grab. Go wild with the marking feature while you're out there. Just, uh, try not to follow it so directly you fly into the sun, okay?"

"Have you been here in Dark Bramble all this time?"
],
"689": [
"...You never were the brightest hatchling, were you."
],
"690": [
"Yeah, that’s right, I’m alive. Been camping out here since my ship, uh, y’know. Crashed. Violently."
],
"691": [
"Wait, what?"
],
"692": [
"You crashed? But you’re the greatest pilot in Hearthian history!"
],
"693": [
"I haven’t lived in polite society for a while, so I’m just going to go ahead and assume that wasn’t sarcasm."
],
"694": [
"What! Me, killed off by thorny, extradimensional plants that entirely violate the laws of space and time, and a couple of giant predatory fish with gaping maws and enormously sharp fangs? Not in this lifetime, little buddy."
],
"695": [
"I set up camp here when my ship got stuck here in Dark Bramble. Been living off the land ever since."
],
"696": [
"So what exactly happened to your ship?"
],
"697": [
"\"Got stuck\"? But aren’t you the greatest pilot in Hearthian history?"
],
"698": [
"Depends on how long \"all this time\" is. I’ve been here a while, I guess. Ever since I crashed my ship into — that is, ever since my daring escape from the jaws of an anglerfish!"
],
"699": [
"Tell me more about your flying prowess!"
],
"700": [
"You crashed your ship, didn’t you."
],
"701": [
"Haha, you flatter me! ...I like it!"
],
"702": [
"Obviously, yes. No need to be rude."
],
"703": [
"...well, like I said, I crash. Blammo! On impact, my ship starts making noises like it’s coming apart from the inside, and I think, well, that ain’t great. Sure enough, I barely get out of there before the electrical systems start sparking like crazy."
],
"704": [
"It’s either move fast or die unpleasantly, so I had to put a little distance between me and my poor, fried ship."
],
"705": [
"I camped out near where I crashed at first. I found this skeleton later — great find, would’ve been stupid not to use it."
],
"706": [
"So I moved my setup over here and planted my emergency tree seeds. Been here ever since!"
],
"707": [
"...Wow."
],
"708": [
"I can’t believe you didn’t die."
],
"709": [
"I can’t believe you destroyed your ship."
],
"710": [
"No wonder there are so many stories about you back home!"
],
"711": [
"My story goes like this. I’d just finished exploring the core of Giant’s Deep, and I wanted to try my hand at Dark Bramble, seeing as no one had ever been before."
],
"712": [
"Getting around in Dark Bramble was easy, mind you. Once you’ve dodged one massive, interdimensional vine bristling with thorns, you’ve dodged ’em all."
],
"713": [
"But after a while, I run into this huge anglerfish — you’ve seen ’em? Big gnarly things, and this was the biggest one I’ve ever seen. I pull a few stunts, try to shake the thing off — nothing too fancy. I’m going full-speed when the fish clips me, knocks me into a vine, and..."
],
"714": [
"Oh, this is a good story. I’d just finished exploring the core of Giant’s Deep and needed a new challenge, and none of us had ever been inside Dark Bramble, so I think, hey, let’s give that a try."
],
"715": [
"I’ve been cruising around for a while, dodging the odd massive, interdimensional vine bristling with thorns, when I run into this huge anglerfish, the biggest I’ve ever seen."
],
"716": [
"I pull a few stunts, try to shake the thing off — nothing too fancy. I’m going full-speed when the fish clips me, knocks me into a vine, and..."
],
"717": [
"Haha, you flatter me! ...I like it!"
],
"718": [
"I came to Dark Bramble for the excitement. I’d just finished exploring the core of Giant’s Deep and needed a new challenge, and none of us had ever gone farther than Dark Bramble’s ice fields, so I thought, hey, let’s give it a try."
],
"719": [
"I’ve been cruising around for a while, dodging the odd massive, interdimensional vine bristling with thorns, when I run into this huge anglerfish, the biggest I’ve ever seen."
],
"720": [
"I pull a few stunts, try to shake the thing off — nothing too fancy. I’m going full-speed when the fish clips me, knocks me into a vine, and..."
],
"721": [
"Yeah, pretty much."
],
"722": [
"You know, in the old days, I used to think the same thing every time I came back from a flight in one piece."
],
"723": [
"These days, I’m used to it."
],
"724": [
"Easy for you to say. Your ship probably has all kinds of fancy modifications and upgrades, like \"working retro boosters\" and \"non-flammable construction materials.\""
],
"725": [
"Heh. You’re not half-bad yourself, making it here in one piece."
],
"726": [
"Anyway, that’s how it all went down, hatchling!"
],
"727": [
"Story’s over, but feel free to stay and enjoy the fire a while."
],
"728": [
"Or don’t. Fire’s not going anywhere."
],
"729": [
"Heh, you got it in one. Kind of hard not to, once you’ve seen one of those fish up close and personal-like."
],
"730": [
"Well, take a load off and refill your oxygen tank, hatchling! There’s plenty of fire to go around."
],
"731": [
"Anything else you wanted?"
],
"732": [
"I found something!"
],
"733": [
"Where should I explore here?"
],
"734": [
"You reached the core of Giant’s Deep? How’d you do it?"
],
"735": [
"Where’s your ship?"
],
"736": [
"What happened to this anglerfish?"
],
"737": [
"Shouldn’t I tell ground control to come get you?"
],
"738": [
"Nah, I’m good."
],
"739": [
"Hey, hatchling, pull up a marshmallow stick!"
],
"740": [
"Come to hear tales of my heroic exploits, have you?"
],
"741": [
"I found something!"
],
"742": [
"Where should I explore here?"
],
"743": [
"You reached the core of Giant’s Deep? How’d you do it?"
],
"744": [
"Where’s your ship?"
],
"745": [
"What happened to this anglerfish?"
],
"746": [
"Shouldn’t I tell ground control to come get you?"
],
"747": [
"Nah, I’m good."
],
"748": [
"Oh, the skeleton? It was like this when I got here."
],
"749": [
"As near as I can tell, this anglerfish must have been chewing on the vine and eaten a seed, and then the seed grew and grew in the poor fish’s stomach until... this happened."
],
"750": [
"Gross, huh?"
],
"751": [
"This skeleton was a good find. Keeps the fish away. See, they’re territorial, so they mostly avoid each other. That’s why I set up camp here."
],
"752": [
"Giant’s Deep’s core, huh? Ahhh, that was a wild one."
],
"753": [
"But since you’re asking, I gotta assume you haven’t made it down there yourself yet, right? If I tell you how, it kinda feels like cheating."
],
"754": [
"Hm..."
],
"755": [
"...On a completely unrelated note, that sure was a big, hollow vine my ship crashed into. Yep."
],
"756": [
"If I were you, I’d go take a walk and see where it ends."
],
"757": [
"You’ll want to go to the tail end of this anglerfish skeleton here and look for a flickering light in the fog — that’ll be my old ship. Path starts there."
],
"758": [
"If you change your mind, you know where to find me!"
],
"759": [
"Well... yeah, sure, whenever you have the time."
],
"760": [
"Frankly, I kinda like it out here. Quiet, peaceful...ish."
],
"761": [
"You’re a little young to understand, but it’s a lot of pressure, being the best that ever was. Been nice to have a break."
],
"762": [
"That’s the spirit!"
],
"763": [
"Anywhere’s good, but you should know that space is weird here. Intensely."
],
"764": [
"Ever tried throwing your scout into one of these weird seeds? See there, with the little opening? It’s just big enough to launch one through."
],
"765": [
"Your scout tracker will tell you the scout is in two places at once, but I don’t think that’s... wrong, exactly, because space doesn’t work right in here. That seed looks small, see? But inside, it’s bigger."
],
"766": [
"Much bigger."
],
"767": [
"I’ve had a lot of time to think about this, and my theory is space in Dark Bramble kind of expands as you go through each sphere. That’s why it’s bigger inside those seeds."
],
"768": [
"Well, that’s my theory. Keep that in mind while you’re exploring Dark Bramble and maybe you won’t get lost inside forever."
],
"769": [
"Good luck!"
],
"770": [
"Not far from here, as a matter of fact! If you go straight past the tail of this anglerfish skeleton here, you’ll see a flickering light in the fog."
],
"771": [
"Follow that, and you’ll find my old ship. What’s left of it, anyway."
],
"772": [
"Lay it on me, hatchling!"
],
"773": [
"I went to the core of Giant’s Deep."
],
"774": [
"I found the frozen jellyfish near your ship."
],
"775": [
"I found the Anglerfish nest."
],
"776": [
"I found a Dark Bramble seed on Timber Hearth."
],
"777": [
"I found Nomai writing saying anglerfish are blind."
],
"778": [
"I found a Nomai shuttle and flew it!"
],
"779": [
"Actually, nevermind."
],
"780": [
"So you figured out the ol’ tornado trick, did you? Good work!"
],
"781": [
"I found that bit out by accident, but let’s keep that between you and me, hey? Hornfels would have my very handsome head if they knew I’d been riding the cyclones again."
],
"782": [
"\"The ship is fragile! It can break! You can’t subject it to extreme conditions!\" Not like I was flying the thing into the sun, now, was I?"
],
"783": [
"And the jellyfish, you figured those out, too? Hatchling, I tell you what, you’ve done real well for yourself! You’re a fine astronaut, sure, but you might just become a pilot yet!"
],
"784": [
"Ha! So the old thing still there, is it? That’s where I first camped out after the crash, you know. It was pretty cozy inside!"
],
"785": [
"It does lack the structural integrity and indomitable spirit of a camp made in the shelter of the very bones of the species that tried to eat you, I suppose."
],
"786": [
"Still. Very cozy."
],
"787": [
"So that’s where the blasted things come from, is it? Stars above, if I still had a working ship, I’d be sorely tempted to go show ’em what’s what!"
],
"788": [
"Sigh..."
],
"789": [
"Probably best to leave ’em alone, though, really. More trouble than it’s worth to mess with anglerfish."
],
"790": [
"...That’s bad business, hatchling."
],
"791": [
"As Chert will tell you if you so much as glance in Dark Bramble’s direction, there used to be a fifth planet where the Bramble is now."
],
"792": [
"This infernal plant appeared at the center and kept growing, and growing, and growing, until it shattered the planet and scattered its pieces across space."
],
"793": [
"If we don’t get that seed you found sorted real quicklike, I suspect Timber Hearth will be heading toward the same fate. And I tell you what, we Hearthians have overcome far too much to be done in by some worthless seed."
],
"794": [
"A-ha! So the blasted things do have a weakness!"
],
"795": [
"Meaning my fly-as-fast-as-I-can approach to dealing with them could have used a bit more thought behind it."
],
"796": [
"Ah, well, at least they didn’t eat me. All’s well that ends well, eh, hatchling?"
],
"797": [
"You flew a Nomaian shuttle? You don’t say! How was it? How did it handle?"
],
"798": [
"Can’t say I’d mind having a go at that myself, hatchling. Once I return to Timber Hearth, maybe that’ll have to be my next stop."
],
"799": [
"A brand-new astronaut, and you’re already a pro adventurer! Outer Wilds Ventures is in good hands with you, I can tell. The flight program is going places!"
],
"800": [
"Nothing you want to share with me? Sounds like you’d better get out there and start exploring!"
],
"801": [
"Despite my checking on them at least a thousand times over, the images are STILL not ready to print over in the radio tower. Well, it’s like they say — a watched satellite never transmits data! (Haha, that’s a little joke for you, journal. No one says that.)",

"Yes."

"Not yet."

"Whatever happens next, I do not think it is to be feared."

"What they could not unlearn was hidden away in darkness — obfuscated, then lost. They did not want to see their story end."
],
"825": [
"My kind weren’t always like this. We weren’t always so afraid. I did what I could to set things right, yet I am still of my kind, and you know now what they did. I cannot promise our fear won’t stain your mind."

"And so, a choice: Are you certain you want to remember me?"

"I don’t want to repeat my kind’s mistakes. But if you’re willing to take the risk, then so am I."

"The radio tower on Timber Hearth was built to receive transmissions from our deep space satellite, and housed some of the last-ever photos taken of the entire solar system."
],
"839": [
"Hornfels noticed a curious anomaly in one of the photos, but it ultimately went unexplained."
],
"840": [
"The radio tower on Timber Hearth was built to receive transmissions from our deep space satellite, and housed some of the last-ever photos taken of the entire solar system."
],
"841": [
"One of these photos revealed the existence of an invisible ring world inhabited by a species whose presence in our solar system predated even the Nomai."
],
"842": [
"This species traveled from a nearby star system in search of the Eye of the universe, but, horrified by what they discovered, decided to block the Eye’s signal so that no one else would ever find it."
],
"843": [
"One individual, however, rebelled against the decision, and was able to briefly release the Eye’s signal back into space before being caught and imprisoned in solitude for this betrayal."
],
"844": [
"CASSAVA: Conoy, Daz and I were lifting Orbital Probe Cannon components into orbit for assembly, and one somehow sank down down beneath the current."
],
"845": [
"DAZ: Cassava convinced me not to try to recreate the phenomenon myself using other cannon parts, but we’re very curious to know what happened! How could something pass through the current?"
],
"846": [
"CONOY: My gratitude for your interesting question! This is exciting: Spire constructed a model of Giant's Deep here at Brittle Hollow's Southern Observatory, and it reveals how an object might sink below the current."
],
"847": [
"CASSAVA: Conoy, I’m unable to grasp the answer by looking through the projection pool. If I visit the observatory, would you kindly explain?"
],
"848": [
"CONOY: If you don’t mind the trek beneath the surface to the south pole, I’d be delighted to see you! (There are two trailheads, one at Brittle Hollow's gravity cannon and one at the Tower of Quantum Knowledge.)"
],
"849": [
"DAZ: Conoy, you should’ve seen it! We’d thought it was impossible for any cannon components to sink even partially below the current, but ours sank straight to the core!"
],
"850": [
"COLEUS: I was upstairs testing the Eye signal locator, and it can hear and follow the signals from the sun, Giant’s Deep, and Brittle Hollow."
],
"851": [
"COLEUS: However, something strange is happening when I ask the Eye signal locator to follow the Eye’s signal: The device’s indicator rotates wildly and never points to just one direction."
],
"852": [
"THATCH: This is a curious result. It’s possible the Eye has stopped calling out its signal."
],
"853": [
"FILIX: I see! I most likely calibrated the locator incorrectly. Privet (my apprentice) and I will make adjustments and try again."
],
"854": [
"FILIX: An update: Disappointingly, everything is correctly calibrated after all."
],
"855": [
"CASSAVA: It saddens me to posit this, my friends, but I believe this locator cannot detect the Eye’s signal. We would need to build a more sensitive device if we want to locate the Eye of the universe."
],
"856": [
"THATCH: Then we will build it. Don’t lose hope, Cassava; our search for the Eye is what brought our clan to this place. We won’t give up so easily!"

"857": [
],
"858": [
"Hey, hey, it’s my favorite astronaut! Launch day at last, huh, buddy? It’s the translator tool’s inaugural flight, too! I’m so excited it’s making me nauseous."
],
"859": [
"Just think - you’ll be able to translate any Nomai text you want, anywhere you are. The two of us put a lot of hours into inventing that tool, so don’t break it, okay? Haha! ...Oh, geez. Do not break it."
],
"860": [
"...Ugh, ignore me, okay? I’m just nervous. And I’m not even the one going into space! How are you feeling?"
],
"861": [
"I’m excited!"
],
"862": [
"I’m terrified!"
],
"863": [
"Good! You’ve only been waiting for this day since we were hatchlings. I can’t wait to see all your training pay off!"
],
"864": [
"Aw, don’t let me make you nervous. You’ve been training for this day since we were hatchlings, remember? You’ll do great, I promise!"
],
"865": [
"So what’s the dirt? You here to see the new Nomai statue?"
],
"866": [
"New statue?"
],
"867": [
"Of course!"
],
"868": [
"Just here for the launch codes."
],
"869": [
"Heh, I knew you’d want to see it before you headed off! Hornfels just finished prepping it for display today. Amazing, isn’t it?"
],
"870": [
"You haven’t heard? Gabbro brought it back with them from Giant’s Deep, and Hornfels just finished prepping it for display. This is it right here. Neat, huh?"
],
"871": [
"Yeah, I get that you’re dying to head out into space, but seriously, you’ve got to see this statue before you go. It’s an amazing find!"
],
"872": [
"Makes me wish we could see what a real live Nomai looks like, but I guess this is as close as we’ll ever get. Check it out - looks like they had fur! Fur is weird."
],
"873": [
"This is the first fully intact statue ever found, you know. And for how old it is, it’s in great shape!"
],
"874": [
"...Ah geez, I got a little carried away there. Go on, you have a ship to launch! Take care of yourself out there, you hear?"
],
"875": [
"Hey, I was just about to come find you! Look look look, you’ve gotta see this — the Nomai statue’s eyes are open!"
],
"876": [
"They, uh, used to be closed. Probably should’ve started with that. And now they’ve opened!"
],
"877": [
"We’re not sure why they opened, since no one actually saw it happen, but this is huge news!"
],
"878": [
"Should someone tell Gabbro? Or maybe Riebeck? Oh, stars, this is so exciting, it’s making my stomach hurt!"
],
"879": [
"Hal! Can you help me translate this new alien language I found?"
],
"880": [
"A new language?! YES! Absolutely! Stars above, you BET I can!"
],
"881": [
"Just give me… let’s call it a hundred samples, some form of epigraphical codex, and six months, and I should have the vague gist of the sort of graphemes this new language is working with!"
],
"882": [
"Gosh, I can’t wait to get started!"
],
"883": [
"Hey again! What’s up?"
],
"884": [
"Where on Giant’s Deep would I find Gabbro?"
],
"885": [
"Where did this statue come from?"
],
"886": [
"Why did the Nomai make this statue?"
],
"887": [
"Think I’ll discover anything cool in space?"
],
"888": [
"Sorry, nevermind."
],
"889": [
"Was there something else?"
],
"890": [
"Where’d you say this statue came from?"
],
"891": [
"Where can I find Gabbro?"
],
"892": [
"Why did the Nomai make this statue?"
],
"893": [
"Think I’ll discover anything cool in space?"
],
"894": [
"Nope, that was it."
],
"895": [
"Good question! So Gabbro found this fully intact statue on Giant’s Deep, right? Well, Hornfels told me it’s made from the same type of special stone as the partial statue Chert brought back from the Hourglass Twins."
],
"896": [
"That’s why when Gabbro, you know, chipped the Giant’s Deep statue, that stone fragment was repurposed for your ship’s computer."
],
"897": [
"Maybe the statues were made for storing information?"
],
"898": [
"From Giant’s Deep! Gabbro fished it out of the oceans and brought it back here for study."
],
"899": [
"Hornfels doesn’t know much about it yet, just that it’s crazy old and super tough. I wonder why the Nomai carved it?"
],
"900": [
"Apparently, Gabbro went back to Giant’s Deep to try to learn more about the statue. Maybe they’ll find some answers there."
],
"901": [
"Hey, you never know — maybe you’ll be the one to solve the mysteries of the Nomai!"
],
"902": [
"Or maybe you’ll discover a new kind of rock or something."
],
"903": [
"But honestly, as long as they don’t end up naming new safety equipment after you, I’m sure you’ll have done a great job."
],
"904": [
"No problem. Take it easy!"
],
"905": [
"Alright then! Be careful out there, okay?"

"RAMIE: Hypothesis: It is possible for an object to exit a white hole before entering the corresponding black hole."
],
"946": [

],
"1427": [
"You know what, don’t worry about it."

"Hornfels doesn’t know much about it yet, just that it’s crazy old and super tough. I wonder why the Nomai carved it?"
],

"Apparently, Gabbro went back to Giant’s Deep to try to learn more about the statue. Maybe they’ll find some answers there."
],
"1452": [
"Good question! You know how Gabbro knocked a fragment off the statue while they were hauling it back from Giant's Deep?"
],
"1453": [
"Hornfels analyzed the fragment and figured out the stone it's made from can store information — I heard Slate ended up repurposing it for your ship’s computer."
],
"1454": [
"I’m not sure what the statue opening its eyes has to do with anything, but maybe the statue was made for storing information, too?"
],
"1455": [
"Hey, you never know — maybe you’ll be the one to uncover the Nomai’s mysteries!"
],
"1456": [
"Or maybe you’ll discover a new kind of rock or something."

"Heyo, hatchling! Thought you were taking that tin can of yours into space today - what’re you still doing here?"
],
"1580": [
"Me? I saw something crash over the horizon and didn’t like what I was seeing in the pictures my Little Scout was sending back, so I thought I’d come over here myself and take a look."
],

"So what crashed?"
],
"1582": [
"Is that a Dark Bramble seed?"
],

"So what crashed?"

"Is that a Dark Bramble seed?"

"Me? That Scout photo you took earlier showed smoke, so I came over to check for fires, remember?"
],
"1589": [
"So what crashed?"
],
"1590": [
"Is that a Dark Bramble seed?"
],
"1591": [
"I dunno what it is, exactly. Looks like some kind of plant seed, but it’s not anything I’ve seen on Timber Hearth before - and trust me, I was quite the explorer back in the day."
],
"1592": [
"D’you think it’s extraterrestrial? It kinda looks like something that might’ve come off of Dark Bramble. Whatever it is, it put down roots in a hurry."
],
"1593": [
"You think so? It’s nothing I’ve ever seen on Timber Hearth before, so you’re probably onto something there."
],
"1594": [
"Whatever it is, it put down roots in a hurry."
],
"1595": [
"I don’t like the look of this thing, hatchling, and that’s a fact. Think I’ll set Marl and Hal loose on it. Best get rid of this mess sooner rather than later, and no one can remove an unwanted plant faster than a tree keeper can."
],
"1596": [
"I’ll have to get a look at what’s inside the seed, first, though. Don’t want to set anybody to hacking up a potentially dangerous plant without a better idea of what’s lurking inside there."
],
"1597": [
"Tuff can help me haul the old scout launcher over here. Obviously the opening is too small for someone to fit inside, and anyway, I’m not gonna blindly stick my hands into anything that looks as unpleasant as that seed does."
],
"1598": [
"That’s a good way to lose an arm or two."
],
"1599": [
"Blasted seed did a lot of damage when it crashed. I liked this crater."
],
"1600": [
"Need something from me, hatchling?"
],
"1601": [
"I threw a Little Scout into the seed."
],
"1602": [
"My signalscope is picking up a harmonica inside the seed."
],
"1603": [
"You’re sure this seed isn’t from Timber Hearth?"
],
"1604": [
"Nope, I’m good."
],
"1605": [
"You did, did you? And you’re telling me it’s bigger on the inside than on the outside?"
],
"1606": [
"Hmph. This is going to be a chore to chop up, and no mistake. Can we even remove a seed that doesn’t have the decency to stay the same size all the way through?"
],
"1607": [
"Maybe I’d better grab an extra axe or three, just in case."
],
"1608": [
"Inside the seed? Huh. Dunno what to tell you there - the only harmonica player I know is Feldspar, and they disappeared ages ago."
],
"1609": [
"Listen here, don’t go telling Gneiss about the harmonica music, okay? They’ll never let me get rid of this darn seed if they suspect it has any musical talent."
],
"1610": [
"Back in my younger days, I explored everywhere there is to go on Timber Hearth and saw everything there is to see, and then some. Trust me, we don’t have anything like this."
],
"1611": [
"Nah, I reckon this thing’s from Dark Bramble if it’s from anywhere, hatchling."
],
"1612": [
"Alright then, see you around."

"1613": [
],
"1614": [

"1615": [
"If it isn’t my favorite troublemaker."

"1617": [
"We wanted to play hide and seek, but Moraine won’t let us borrow their signalscope because it’s “really delicate” and “not supposed to be thrown around like that.”"
],
"1618": [
"Hey, hey, can we use your Signalscope? Can we? Can we, please? We’ll even let you be \"it\"!"
],
"1619": [
"Sure, let’s play!"
],
"1620": [
"Sorry, can’t today."
],
"1621": [
"Woohoo! Okay, here are the rules. Galena and me will hide with these radios, and you’ll use your Signalscope to find us."
],
"1622": [
"Last one to be found wins! Okay, close your eyes and start counting!"
],
"1623": [
"Awww, really? But we can’t play without a Signalscope... Play with us later, okay?"
],
"1624": [
"Awww, you found me? But my hiding spot was super good!"
],
"1625": [
"Don’t forget, you have to find both of us, okay?"
],
"1626": [
"You got me, but I’m the last one. I win!"
],
"1627": [
"Promise you’ll play again when you get back from space, okay? You gotta!"

"...What?"
],
"1634": [
"Don’t worry, I’ll come back."
],
"1635": [
"That’s pretty disturbing."
],
"1636": [
"Yeah, um, Hornfels says Feldspar went away into space and didn’t come back. Hornfels says Feldspar was the best pilot ever, but no one knows what happened to them."
],
"1637": [
"Hornfels probably shouldn’t be telling you stuff like this."
],
"1638": [
"That’s not something I want to think about right now."
],
"1639": [
"Hornfels says that, too."
],
"1640": [
"But if Feldspar disappeared, you might disappear, too, right?"
],
"1641": [
"You’re not as good as Feldspar, so you should be really careful not to get lost."
],
"1642": [
"That’s what Feldspar said, too, but they never did."
],
"1643": [
"Hornfels will be really sad if you don’t come back, like how sad it makes them to talk about Feldspar. So you should make sure you don’t get lost in space, too."
],
"1644": [
"But Hornfels says no one knows what happened to Feldspar. Hornfels says they got lost in space even though they were the best pilot ever."
],
"1645": [
"You’re not as good as Feldspar, so you should be really careful not to get lost."

"1660": [

"1681": [
"Is anything on fire?"

"1682": [
"Yeah, they were on firewatch with the old scout launcher and saw smoke, so they went to check it out. \"Safety first,\" right?"
],
"1683": [
"...No, I'm kidding. I said that to Tektite once. Pretty rude how long they laughed for, if you ask me."
],
"1684": [
"Probably only a little. Tektite checked out the crash site with the old firewatch scout launcher and saw smoke, so they headed over to stamp out any leftover fires."

],
"1758": [
"What are you doing here?"
],
"1759": [
"I’m in a hurry — can I ask you something?"
],
"1760": [
"I’m here to see the Hanging City. It’s always been my dream to see it with my own four eyes, ever since I was a hatchling."
],
"1761": [
"An alien race lived in this solar system long before our species even existed! How could I not want to see what their civilization was like?"
],
"1762": [
"Only..."
],
"1763": [
"You’ve... probably heard the others say it, right? I’m afraid of space. Seriously, I’m more surprised than anybody that I’m out here."
],
"1764": [
"Do you want to know how I even got this far? I fell. Tripped over a gravity crystal. It’s dumb luck I landed somewhere my Little Scout says is halfway stable, instead of being sucked into... what’s below."
],
"1765": [
"I’ve been gauging the stability of the ground around me using my Little Scout, and this seems to be the place with the best surface integrity, so I’m just going to stay here until I’m ready to move on."
],
"1766": [
"...But that’s enough about me and my problems. You didn’t come all this way to listen to me blather, did you! Heh, that’d be... yeah."
],
"1767": [
"Hi! ...What’s up?"
],
"1768": [
"Um, sure — of course! Anything you want."

"Where should I explore here?"
],
"1772": [
"What are you doing out here?"
],
"1773": [
"See you later."
],
"1774": [
"Me? I’m an archeologist, remember?"
],
"1775": [
"Or, um, the archeologist, I guess. Seeing as I’m all Timber Hearth’s got right now."
],
"1776": [
"Brittle Hollow is rich with Nomai history. That’s why I’m here. This planet is an absolute treasure trove of culture, history, and science."
],
"1777": [
"If you have any questions about the Brittle Hollow Nomai, I’m your Hearthian! Or, um... I have some knowledge of them, I mean. So. Maybe I can help?"
],
"1778": [
"Oh wow, where shouldn’t you explore here? Um, not the black hole, actually. That’s... very no."
],
"1779": [
"Which is unfortunate, because uh, the most exciting stuff is all below the crust. Including the Hanging City — that’s just to the north. You can kinda see it from here."
],
"1780": [
"There’s also this big dome on the south pole called the Southern Observatory. You can’t get inside from the surface — trust me, I tried — but if it’s like the rest of the Nomai structures here, there’s probably a path to it beneath the crust somewhere."
],
"1781": [
"Good luck with exploring. Um, if you learn anything about the Nomai, I’d love to hear it, if it’s not too much trouble?"
],
"1782": [
"Oh, cool! Um, what is it?"
],
"1783": [
"I found the Nomai escape pod on Brittle Hollow."
],
"1784": [
"I found the Vessel!"
],
"1785": [
"I saw the old settlement."
],
"1786": [
"I saw the Hanging City on Brittle Hollow."
],
"1787": [
"I saw the Sunless City on Ember Twin."
],
"1788": [
"I found Nomai writing about a quantum pilgrimage."
],
"1789": [
"I went to the comet, and..."
],
"1790": [
"I TALKED TO A LIVING NOMAI!"
],
"1791": [
"Actually, nevermind."
],
"1792": [
"Oh, okay. If you do find learn something new about the Nomai, though, I’d love to hear it! Um, if you don’t mind, I mean."
],
"1793": [
"Wow! So then, the Nomai probably came here from somewhere outside the solar system. And they must have been in trouble when they launched their escape pod... but what kind of trouble?"
],
"1794": [
"And where did the escape pod launch from? I’m so curious!"
],
"1795": [
"This is an amazing discovery. I hope we can find out more about how and why the Nomai arrived here!"
],
"1796": [
"You did?! That, that’s incredible, congratulations!"
],
"1797": [
"That means they really were from far outside our solar system. Haha, yes! I knew it!"
],
"1798": [
"But that creates so many new questions! If they didn’t come from our solar system, where did they come from? Are they from our galaxy, or somewhere even farther? What were their lives like before they came here? And why did they come here?"
],
"1799": [
"Hey, I... I might not be much of an astronaut, but I’m really glad I came out here to see the Nomai’s artifacts for myself. And, um, thanks for telling me. About the Vessel, I mean."
],
"1800": [
"Isn’t it amazing? Hard to believe the settlement is still standing, but there it is."
],
"1801": [
"It really makes you appreciate living somewhere like Timber Hearth. You know, somewhere that isn’t being constantly bombarded with meteors and rocks and stuff."
],
"1802": [
"You visited the Hanging City? Oh gosh, how was it? Was it amazing? Was it beautiful? ...Was it scary?"
],
"1803": [
"The Hanging City is where the Nomai settled permanently on Brittle Hollow. It was their most advanced settlement here!"
],
"1804": [
"Why they chose to build their most advanced settlement so close to a you-know-what is beyond me. Maybe that kind of thing makes sense to a Nomai, though. ...Maybe they needed the black hole for something?"
],
"1805": [
"You mean there’s another Nomai city inside of Ember Twin? That’s incredible! A whole city, and I had no idea it existed! This is great!"
],
"1806": [
"How did they keep the sand out? If it were me, I’d be nervous about getting buried in the caves by that awful river of sand. Gosh, the Nomai sure were ingenius, building an entire settlement underground. The Sunless City! ...Wow!"
],
"1807": [
"That means there were two groups of Nomai — one that lived on Ember Twin, and one that lived here on Brittle Hollow. But they must have traveled around the solar system, since Nomai writing can be found on other planets, too."
],
"1808": [
"A pilgrimage to the Quantum Moon? The Nomai mentioned the Quantum Moon in a lot of their writing, so it was clearly special to them. And um, special enough to make a trip there by themselves!"
],
"1809": [
"It sounds like a coming-of-age ritual, like how hatchlings stay hatchlings until their stomachs are strong enough to drink sap wine."
],
"1810": [
"Maybe once a Nomai journeyed to the Quantum Moon, they were considered an adult?"
],
"1811": [
"Oh, wow. Wow. So that’s how the Nomai died?"
],
"1812": [
"That’s... really sad, isn’t it? I know it was a long time ago, but still..."
],
"1813": [
"Stars above, it’s lucky we hadn’t evolved to live on land yet."
],
"1814": [
"To think, if the comet hadn’t killed them, our species might have coexisted in this solar system. That would have been amazing."
],
"1815": [
"But..."
],
"1816": [
"I guess if I hadn’t wanted to learn why the Nomai disappeared, I’d never have left Timber Hearth and come out here, or had any of these adventures."
],
"1817": [
"...Don’t get me wrong, space is terrifying! But, you know, it has its moments."
],
"1818": [
"AHHH! That doesn’t make any sense! I don’t understand! I am very excited for you, though! P-please stop yelling!"
],
"1819": [
"...What? On the Quantum Moon, you said? There’s a sort of-living Nomai on the Quantum Moon?!"
],
"1820": [
"WELL, WHY DIDN’T YOU SAY SO?!"
],
"1821": [
"Oh wow! Wow! This is the best thing that’s ever happened in the history of Outer Wilds Ventures! I can’t believe you talked to an actual Nomai!"
],
"1822": [
"Great! So I just have to go back into space, fly to the Quantum Moon with zero visibility, find a spooky ruin, and travel through a few different types of dangerous terrain to get there."
],
"1823": [
"Okay, yeah, that’s... that’s not so bad. That’s probably doable..."
],
"1824": [
"This piece of Nomai writing was essential to deciphering their unique language."
],
"1825": [
"Although this text is linear, Nomai text often branches off from a central point. Interestingly, each branch tends to be written by a different author."
],
"1826": [
"What you see here are parts of the Nomai skeleton. We can tell from their skulls that they possessed antlers and, quite unusually, only three eyes."
],
"1827": [
"The Nomai body was most likely adapted for living exclusively on land. The differences in the Nomai’s anatomy, such as their shockingly fragile bone structure, show us that Hearthians couldn’t have descended from Nomaian ancestors."
],
"1828": [
"It’s not clear where the Nomai originated from, or why they disappeared. We hope to find more clues to this puzzle as we explore our solar system."
],
"1829": [
"The Nomai who came to our solar system were following a signal from the Eye of the universe."
],
"1830": [
"They perished when the Interloper arrived, bringing with it the deadly substance we called ghost matter that flooded the entire solar system almost instantly and without warning."
],
"1831": [
"We never figured out how they died."
],
"1832": [
"Stars like our sun generate light and heat by fusing hydrogen into helium."
],
"1833": [
"As it grows older, the star runs out of hydrogen and starts to contract."
],
"1834": [
"As the star’s core contracts, it gets hotter, causing the outer layers to expand. The star has become a red giant."
],
"1835": [
"When the core is hot enough, it starts to fuse helium into carbon."
],
"1836": [
"If a star is massive enough, it will continue to fuse carbon into even heavier elements like iron."
],
"1837": [
"Ultimately, the star will collapse under its own gravity and then explode in a violent event called a supernova."
],
"1838": [
"Based on Chert's observations, this will one day be the fate of our own sun."
],
"1839": [
"At the end of its lifespan, our sun collapsed under its own gravity and then exploded in a violent supernova."
],
"1840": [
"Watch closely... these balls move on their own!"
],
"1841": [
"The ground is perfectly level, so what do you think causes this spooky motion?"
],
"1842": [
"The answer is the moon! As it orbits our planet, the Attlerock’s gravity pulls on objects from different directions. In fact, it’s pulling on you right now!"
],
"1843": [
"ROOT: I was hoping to deliver new ore data to Poke in her Black Hole Forge, but the warp tower on the Twilight Twin sent me to the wrong part of Brittle Hollow."
],
"1844": [
"ROOT: Could someone kindly remind me if there’s a way to warp directly to the forge or if I imagined this?"
],
"1845": [
"CLARY: There is! The Brittle Hollow warp tower that stands on the Twilight Twin will take you to two different places, including the forge. Just make sure you start at the correct place within the tower."

],
"1849": [
"CLARY: To speed future deliveries to Ash Twin, I’ve tuned the first black hole core to activate when its warp tower aligns with Brittle Hollow."
],
"1850": [
"CLARY: And before anyone comments, yes, I am aware this reduces the distance between Yarrow and me."
],
"1851": [
"ROOT: The schematic shows the six towers on Ash Twin are being tuned to only five alignments. Is that a mistake?"
],
"1852": [
"POKE: No, that’s correct. For these alignments we've decided to treat the Hourglass Twins as a single astral body."
],
"1853": [
"POKE: Have you seen Phlox’s tower designs in the High Energy Lab on Ember Twin? They clarify each tower’s warp destination."

],

],
"1919": [
"SOLANUM: Given the Quantum Moon is the Eye’s moon, it’s likely that any characteristics the moon exhibits are also exhibited by the Eye itself. The Quantum Moon and its shards, for instance, are quantum; thus, the Eye is likely also quantum."

"SOLANUM: Because the Quantum Moon clearly changes in its different forms, the Eye (being this moon’s primary location) must be similarly malleable."

"2129": [
"Actually. I guess it’s been a long time since I’ve seen anyone."
],
"2130": [
"Don’t the other travelers come by?"
],
"2131": [
"Was that you whistling?"
],
"2132": [
"Seems lonely up here."

"What is this place?"
],
"2134": [
"Marl says hi."
],
"2135": [
"Talk to you later."
],
"2136": [
"Don’t go! Uh, I mean, anything else you wanted to ask?"
],
"2137": [
"Don’t the other travelers come by?"
],
"2138": [
"Seems lonely up here."
],
"2139": [
"Was that you whistling?"

"2140": [
"What is this place?"

"2142": [
"Talk to you later."
],
"2143": [
"The Lunar Outpost saw more traffic back when our ships were less sophisticated and needed more frequent repairs. Nowadays, it’s mostly used to keep a set of eyes on things."
],
"2144": [
"Sometimes Chert comes by to say hi, but Gabbro is Gabbro, and you know how Riebeck feels about “unnecessary spaceflight.”"
],
"2145": [
"A little. I’m in touch with ground control – Hornfels and Gossan, mostly – and they radio up to chat now and then."
],
"2146": [
"And when ground control forgets I’m up here and they usually do, I launch my Little Scout at the village."
],
"2147": [
"They forget about you?"
],
"2148": [
"You spy on us?"
],
"2149": [
"I don’t blame them. For one, I don’t check in as often as the other travelers, since I’m always in one place."
],
"2150": [
"And it’s not so bad up here, really. At least it’s peaceful and quiet. You don’t always get that in our solar system."
],
"2151": [
"Let alone in our village."
],
"2152": [
"What? No! It’s not spying, it’s..."
],
"2153": [
"It’s one-way communication. That none of the villagers know about. Because I’ve never told them."
],
"2154": [
"Probably. Or actually, definitely. The other travelers carry instruments, so they don’t bother whistling."
],
"2155": [
"You can pick up their music with a signalscope, you know. Best spot for that is the north pole. Great reception."
],
"2156": [
"The north pole is marked in red on your mini map, but the Attlerock is a pretty small moon, really. Just go north. You can’t miss it."
],
"2157": [
"Ha ha, very funny. ...Oh, stars above, you’re serious, aren’t you? That’s just depressing."
],
"2158": [
"Sigh...Welcome to the Lunar Outpost, which apparently the space program doesn’t bother to teach anyone anymore."
],
"2159": [
"When we first started Outer Wilds, travelers used to bring their ships here all the time for repairs. Our spacefaring technology has improved loads since then, but the older ships tended to, uh, fall apart a lot. Like, more than they do now."
],
"2160": [
"Using the outpost cut down on the number of launches and landings taking place in the village and also the number of fires. Nowadays, though, it’s mostly just me up here raising saplings from Timber Hearth and keeping an eye on things."
],
"2161": [
"Heh, Marl is probably the only one who remembers I’m up here. I should go see the big lug soon."
],
"2162": [
"Don’t tell them about this, but sometimes I throw my Little Scout down to make sure Marl isn’t doing anything stupid. I worry that big tree in the village wouldn’t stand a chance otherwise."
],
"2163": [
"Hi again. Can’t get enough of the moon? ...I’m kidding."
],
"2164": [
"Do you hear music?"
],
"2165": [
"Aren’t you forgetting someone?"
],
"2166": [
"I can’t wait to play with the whole group again. Can I start?"
],
"2167": [
"Yes."
],
"2168": [
"Not yet."
],
"2169": [
"Ok, I won’t let you down!"
],
"2170": [
"Oh, ok. I’ll– I’ll get to play soon though, right?"
],
"2171": [
"Wow... How long has it been since I got to make music with everyone around a campfire?"
],
"2172": [
"I’m really happy we’re all here."
],
"2173": [
"Hatchling! You found me!"
],
"2174": [
"Nice to have company around a campfire, isn’t it? Go on, go get the others. Wouldn’t want ’em to miss out!"
],
"2175": [
"Whaddya say, then — should I get out the ol’ harmonica?"
],
"2176": [
"Yes."
],
"2177": [
"Not yet."
],
"2178": [
"Ha ha! Here goes nothing!"
],
"2179": [
"You got it hatchling. When you’re ready, just say the word."
],
"2180": [
"You cut it a little close, don’t you think?"
],
"2181": [
"Well, it worked out all right in the end, I suppose."
],
"2182": [
"Ahh, I hope there are beasties in the next one."
],
"2183": [
"Trip 4(?), entry #... I’m gonna say “not 1.” \nCrashes: 3 \nBoring crashes: 0 (a personal best!)"
],
"2184": [
"Whoa ho! Never thought I’d see one of these beasties outside of Giant’s Deep! They were awfully useful back there — maybe a jellyfish could be useful here, too?"
],
"2185": [
"BLEARGH. This thing tastes terrible! The outside is all rubbery and tough -- maybe that’s because it insulates the jellyfish’s insides from getting zapped by electricity?"
],
"2186": [
"Right, I’m going inside of this jellyfish’s interior cavity to see if what’s in there tastes any better."
],
"2187": [
"Note to Feldspar: DO NOT EAT THIS EVEN IF YOU ARE DYING. It would be too sad if this were the last thing you ever ate in this life."
],
"2188": [
"I guess these jellyfish are only useful for insulation from electricity. Again, DO NOT EAT. (Love, Feldspar)"
],
"2189": [
"Nice, it’s you. Good to see you made it here in one piece. The first solo launch is a doozy, isn’t it?"
],
"2190": [
"So hey, don’t laugh, but I think I might have had some kind of spiritual experience with a rock shaped like a face."
],
"2191": [
"...What?"
],
"2192": [
"Me too!"
],
"2193": [
"One of the islands on Giant’s Deep has a Nomai statue on the beach - ever seen one? I brought one back to Timber Hearth with me. Big stone sculpture of a Nomai’s head, three eyes and everything. Beautifully carved, too."
],
"2194": [
"So one minute I’m standing on an island looking at a Nomai sculpture on the beach, and the next thing I know, it’s looking back at me, glowing."
],
"2195": [
"The sculpture replays everything I’ve just done, like it’s been watching me through my own eyes, you know? And then suddenly it stops and everything’s normal again."
],
"2196": [
"That happened to me at the observatory."
],
"2197": [
"You too, huh?"
],
"2198": [
"You’re saying the statue I brought to the museum started glowing at you? Yeah, sounds about right."
],
"2199": [
"One minute I’m standing on an island looking at a Nomai sculpture on the beach, and the next thing I know, it’s looking back at me, glowing."
],
"2200": [
"It replays everything I’ve just done, like it’s been watching me through my own eyes, you know? And then suddenly it stops and everything’s normal again."
],
"2201": [
"It didn’t seem bad, just... weird? Were we the only ones who saw that happen?"
],
"2202": [
"I tried radioing Hornfels and asking them about it, but they told me I must have just nodded off out here and gotten confused."
],
"2203": [
"Then we talked about dreams until Hornfels told me to go refill my oxygen tank before I talked myself to death."
],
"2204": [
"So that’s what’s new with me. But hey, this is your first solo voyage! Let’s talk about you, you know?"
],
"2205": [
"Have you ever stared at a cyclone for so long, it started to hypnotize you? I’m telling you, they’ll pull you into a trance if you look at ’em long enough."
],
"2206": [
"I found a photo of you inside the old radio tower."
],
"2207": [
"Well, what are any of us doing here, really?"
],
"2208": [
"...Nah, I’m just kidding. I’m out here exploring our solar system, same as you."
],
"2209": [
"But I tell you what, outer space really gives you room to think. It’s quiet and peaceful out here."
],
"2210": [
"I mean, it’s usually quiet and peaceful. Sometimes a cyclone comes by and lifts my little island paradise clean out of the water. Then: less peaceful."
],
"2211": [
"Here’s something you might like — I saw a bright flash in the sky not too long ago. Something must have happened up there in orbit around the planet."
],
"2212": [
"What else, what else... Have you been to Statue Island? That’s what I’ve been calling it, seeing as it’s the island where I found the glowing Nomai statue. ...Get it?"
],
"2213": [
"I was on the beach on Statue Island when the whole glowy business happened, by the way. It’s a nice beach for that kind of thing. I give it a solid 7 out of 10 on the Gabbro Relaxation Scale."
],
"2214": [
"If you feel like checking out Statue Island, it’s the one with two islands connected by a natural rock arch. Well... mostly connected, anyway. You’ll see."
],
"2215": [
"Haha, I know, right?"
],
"2216": [
"...Oh, you meant, like, tell you more about it? I gotcha. Well, Giant’s Deep is massive, and mostly water. No surprises there."
],
"2217": [
"There’s a strong current a ways beneath the surface that prevents anything from sinking below it. Seriously, I tried everything I could think of to get past that current, and neither idea worked."
],
"2218": [
"As for land masses, I’ve counted four islands, including this one. There’s also the one with that Nomai statue I saw on the beach."
],
"2219": [
"You’ve seen the cyclones? Yeah, they’re hard to miss. They’ll toss up everything in their path, islands included. Little tip — if you get picked up, try to land in water. Less likely to kill you."
],
"2220": [
"Nice, it’s you. Good to see you made it here in one piece. The first solo launch is a doozy, isn’t it?"
],
"2221": [
"So hey, don’t laugh, but I think I might have just, like, died? Somehow?"
],
"2222": [
"Do you remember, y’know, dying a few minutes ago? Maybe?"
],
"2223": [
"Oh yeah, we definitely died."
],
"2224": [
"I think we’re the only ones who know."
],
"2225": [
"Okay, cool, that’s what I thought. It was all way too vivid to be a dream."
],
"2226": [
"I tried radioing Hornfels and asking them if they had died, too, but they thought I was being metaphorical."
],
"2227": [
"Yeah, I tried radioing Hornfels and asking them if they had died, too, but they thought I was being metaphorical or something."
],
"2228": [
"Well, if you remember dying, then I guess I didn’t just fall asleep and have a bad dream or something. I dunno what’s going on, though. Today’s been weird."
],
"2229": [
"Like, I was on a different island earlier, right? I was on the beach looking at one of those big stone statues of a Nomai head, and the next thing I know, it’s looking back at me, glowing."
],
"2230": [
"The statue replays everything I’ve just done, like it’s been watching me through my own eyes, you know? And then suddenly it stops and everything’s normal again."
],
"2231": [
"That happened to me at the observatory."
],
"2232": [
"Come to think of it, when I died, I saw what I’m pretty sure were my memories going backward, just like that time with the statue. Do you think the Nomai statues are related to us dying somehow?"
],
"2233": [
"And another thing - we died, but we aren’t dead? That’s pretty unusual for Hearthians."
],
"2234": [
"Well, that’s what’s new with me. But hey, this is your first solo voyage! Let’s talk about you, you know?"
],
"2235": [
"Have you ever stared at a cyclone for so long, it started to hypnotize you? I’m telling you, they’ll put you in a trance if you look at ’em long enough."

],
"2239": [
"I mean, it’s usually quiet and peaceful. Sometimes a cyclone comes by and lifts my little island paradise clean out of the water. Then: less peaceful."
],
"2240": [
"Well actually, after waking up from, you know, dying, I saw the same bright flash in the sky. Something must be happening up there in orbit around the planet."
],
"2241": [
"What else, what else... Have you been to Statue Island? That’s what I’ve been calling it, seeing as it’s the island where I found the glowing Nomai statue. ...Get it?"
],

],
"2249": [
"Okay, here’s a weird one for you — I think I might have just, like, died? Somehow?"
],
"2250": [
"I radioed Hornfels at the observatory to ask them about it, but they’re convinced I fell asleep out here and had a nightmare something."
],
"2251": [
"Do you remember, y’know, dying a few minutes ago? Maybe?"
],
"2252": [
"Oh yeah, we definitely died."
],
"2253": [
"I think we’re the only ones who know."
],
"2254": [
"Okay, cool, that’s what I thought. It was all way too vivid to be a dream."
],
"2255": [
"I radioed Hornfels again to ask if they had died, too, but I’m pretty sure they thought I was being metaphorical."
],
"2256": [
"Yeah, I radioed Hornfels again to ask if they had died, too, but I’m pretty sure they thought I was being metaphorical."
],
"2257": [
"Well, if you remember dying, then I guess I didn’t just fall asleep and have a weird dream or something. But stars above, what’s going on, then? And then there was that thing with the Nomai statue earlier..."
],
"2258": [
"Come to think of it, when I died, I saw what I’m pretty sure were my memories going backward, just like the time with that statue. Do you think the Nomai statues are related to us dying somehow?"
],
"2259": [
"So... we died, but we aren’t dead? That’s pretty unusual for Hearthians."
],
"2260": [
"I am going to need to do some serious thinking before I come up with any theories. Maybe I’ll have figured something out by the next time you come by."
],
"2261": [
"Hey again. If you feel like roasting a mallow, feel free to use my campfire. It’s just up the path a little ways."
],
"2262": [
"So what’s up?"
],
"2263": [
"Well, what are any of us doing here, really?"
],
"2264": [
"...Nah, I’m just kidding. I’m out here exploring our solar system, same as you."

"But I tell you what, outer space really gives you room to think. It’s quiet and peaceful out here."

"2276": [
"Hey, time pal. So you’re getting the band back together, huh?"
],
"2277": [
"Go on, go find the others. I’ll be here. You don’t need me yet, but you will."
],
"2278": [
"What do you say, time buddy? Ready to start the music?"
],
"2279": [
"Yes."
],
"2280": [
"Not yet."
],
"2281": [
"Heh, this should be cool."
],
"2282": [
"No rush, I’m not going anywhere."
],
"2283": [
"I tell you what, this has been really fun. And I got to help make something pretty cool, so I’ve got no complaints."
],
"2284": [
"I mean, not me, exactly, but close enough."
],
"2285": [
"It’s the kind of thing that makes you glad you stopped and smelled the pine trees along the way, you know?"
],
"2286": [
],
"2287": [
"There you are! I just finished pre-flight observations, and local conditions are good. Time to get our newest astronaut off the ground!"
],
"2288": [
"And you’ll be our first astronaut ever equipped with a Nomai translator tool! I confess, I’ve been giddy all day just thinking about it."
],
"2289": [
"We’re better equipped than ever to unravel the mysteries of the Nomai. You and Hal should be very proud of your work!"
],
"2290": [
"Tell me, what’s your plan once you’re in space?"
],
"2291": [
"I’m going to learn more about the Nomai."
],
"2292": [
"I’ll meet up with the other travelers."
],
"2293": [
"I want to go somewhere no one’s gone before."
],
"2294": [
"I think I’ll start with something small."
],
"2295": [
"I don’t know."
],
"2296": [
"I’m gonna wing it!"
],
"2297": [
"I might have guessed as much! No sense in making a translator tool if you’re not going to use it to translate anything."
],
"2298": [
"We’ve barely scratched the surface of the Nomai writing in our solar system, so we still know very little about them. We’ve no idea if they originated here or traveled here, or why they disappeared."
],
"2299": [
"That tool of yours should prove indispensible in solving the mystery of this ancient species!"
],
"2300": [
"You’re going to check in with them, are you? Not a bad plan - no one knows the solar system better than our astronauts."
],
"2301": [
"Let’s see... Chert is on the Hourglass Twins, Riebeck is on Brittle Hollow, and Gabbro is on Giant’s Deep, last I checked."
],
"2302": [
"And... Well, there’s Feldspar, obviously, but of course we don’t know where they are, or if they’re even alive."
],
"2303": [
"Feldspar has been lost for a very long time, I’m afraid."
],
"2304": [
"...On a more cheerful note, you’ll find Esker stationed on the Attlerock. They’re not a traveler so much as a lunar local, but I’m sure they’d appreciate a visit nevertheless."
],
"2305": [
"I like it! You’ll have plenty of options to choose from."
],
"2306": [
"No one’s ever landed on the Interloper before, you know. Perhaps you’ll be the first?"
],
"2307": [
"I must say... Should you choose to go to Dark Bramble, be very careful. No one’s explored there before, either, for what you’ll find are excellent reasons."
],
"2308": [
"You’d prefer to ease into things? That’s a sensible plan! More sensible than most of our astronauts tend to be, and that’s a fact."
],
"2309": [
"Do you think you’ll go to the Attlerock, then? Our moon would be a safe place to travel to and get your bearings in space, and I’m sure Esker would appreciate the visit."
],
"2310": [
"Plus, we don’t know what the ancient Nomai ruins on the moon are, or why they were built. You could put your new translator tool through its paces!"
],
"2311": [
"Haha! Overwhelmed by the options, perhaps? I don’t blame you."
],
"2312": [
"If you need help getting started, you could go visit Esker on the moon. They’re alone on the Attlerock most of the time, so I’m sure they’d appreciate it."
],
"2313": [
"Plus, we don’t know what the ancient Nomai ruins on the moon are, or why they were built. You could put your new translator tool through its paces!"
],
"2314": [
"Planning to follow in the footsteps of Feldspar and the great Outer Wilds Ventures tradition, are you? I might have guessed."
],
"2315": [
"Well, see if you can’t put that translator tool of yours to good use while you’re out there!"
],
"2316": [
"Well then, looks like all that’s left is to send you off! All in all, it’s a fine day for a launch!"
],
"2317": [
"I’m ready to get off this rock!"
],
"2318": [
"I’m ready to die in space."
],
"2319": [
"Excellent! You’ll be needing the launch codes, then."
],
"2320": [
"Here they are. Best get off the ground before Slate makes any more modifications to your ship, eh?"
],
"2321": [
"Good luck out there! Let me know if I can help you with anything."
],
"2322": [
"I’m not one for superstition, but isn’t that kind of unlucky to say before a launch?"
],
"2323": [
"At any rate, here are the launch codes. Try not to worry too much - our ships are every bit as safe as Slate could be persuaded to make them."
],
"2324": [
"Best of luck out there! Let me know if I can help you with anything."
],
"2325": [
"Hello again!"
],
"2326": [
"Back so soon?"
],
"2327": [
"Was there something you needed?"
],
"2328": [
"I found Feldspar!"
],
"2329": [
"The Nomai statue opened its eyes!"
],
"2330": [
"Where are the other travelers?"
],
"2331": [
"Tell me more about Feldspar."
],
"2332": [
"No thanks, I’m good."
],
"2333": [
"Well, let’s see... Chert is on the Hourglass Twins, Riebeck is on Brittle Hollow, and Gabbro is on Giant’s Deep."
],
"2334": [
"And... there’s Feldspar, obviously, but of course we don’t know where they are, or if they’re even still alive."
],
"2335": [
"Feldspar has been lost for a very long time, I’m afraid."
],
"2336": [
"Feldspar was one of the four founding members of Outer Wilds, along with our flight coach Gossan, Slate the engineer, and me."
],
"2337": [
"As ground control and later the museum curator, I didn’t work with Feldspar as closely as Slate and Gossan did. I can tell you Feldspar was absolutely fearless, though. Nothing scared them."
],
"2338": [
"Test-piloted everything Slate ever built! It’s a wonder Feldspar lived to see space, frankly, but they did. Flew all sorts of dangerous stunts and explored everything they could find."
],
"2339": [
"And then one day, they just... didn’t come back. We don’t know what happened, or where Feldspar went, or even whether they’re still alive."
],
"2340": [
"It’s been a long time since they left."
],
"2341": [
"What? You say the statue opened its eyes and looked at you?!"
],
"2342": [
"...How wonderful for you."
],
"2343": [
"No, truly, that’s wonderful! It really is. ...Even if I have been pouring over it every night for weeks. It’s stupendous you were able to get a reaction from the statue just by glancing at it a few times."
],
"2344": [
"Ergh, sorry, that’s not a very scientific thing to say, is it? I am glad. I’m just also insufferably, profoundly jealous. You’ll have to forgive me."
],
"2345": [
"That aside - I have research to do! I wonder why the statue opened its eyes. Surely this means they aren’t mere decorative ornaments...?"
],
"2346": [
"You found Feldspar?! And they’re in Dark Bramble?! Stars above, this is wonderful news! Thank you! Thank you for finding them!"
],
"2347": [
"That Feldspar didn’t immediately join you on your ship and return here is incredibly Feldspar of them. We were never entirely sure what Feldspar was thinking back then, either."
],
"2348": [
"Still, we ought to fish them out of that dreadful place with all haste! I’ll radio Gossan and have them prepare a ship. It really should be Gossan who brings Feldspar home."
],
"2349": [
"Again, thank you. You can hardly imagine how profoundly happy I am to hear they’re alive and unharmed."
],
"2350": [
"Take care!"
],
"2351": [
"Hey, look at this - the statue opened its eyes! Bet you wish you’d seen that happen, huh? Sigh... Me, too."
],
"2352": [
"I’m not even a little closer to understanding what’s going on with this statue."
],

"Hornfel’s Observations"
],
"2354": [
"This is incredible! At first I thought the points of light in this image were stars, but they’re not... they’re galaxies!"
],
"2355": [
"And this image covers just a tiny patch of the whole sky, which means the universe contains at least a thousand times more galaxies than we previously imagined."
],
"2356": [
"I... I think I need to sit down."
],
"2357": [
"Hmmm, this is odd. According to my redshift calculations, every single galaxy in this image is moving away from us."
],
"2358": [
"In fact, the farther away a galaxy is, the faster it appears to be moving away."
],
"2359": [
"It’s almost as if the entire universe is expanding."
],
"2360": [
"But if that’s true, was everything closer together in the past? And how far back can we extrapolate? Did the universe have a beginning?"
],
"2361": [

"Any good sounds from space today?"
],
"2369": [
"I’m using my signalscope to pick up sounds from distant planets."
],
"2370": [
"It’s set to the Outer Wilds Ventures frequency so I can pick up the travelers’ music."
],
"2371": [
"There are! My signalscope is set to the Outer Wilds Ventures frequency, so I’m listening to the travelers’ music."
],
"2372": [
"Last night I heard Riebeck’s banjo coming from Brittle Hollow. I hope that means they’re safe."
],
"2373": [
"I can hear different planets, too! It depends on what time of day or night it is, since different planets are in the sky at different times."
],
"2374": [
